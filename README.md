I was inspired by Label Pardhega and got the idea to build this project. Basically, I want to extract information about the ingredients and additives in packaged foods and use LLM and RAG architecture to assess the product and find out the following:
1. The product claim vs. the reality.
2. The ideal consumption frequency for a normal human.
3. The long-term effects of the product and the possibility of causing allergies from any additives or ingredients.

   
This is the initial plan for the project:
